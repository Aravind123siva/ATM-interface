Abstract:

This project showcases a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface implemented in Python. The interface offers basic functionalities typically found in ATM systems, such as checking account balance, withdrawing cash, and depositing funds. Developed with simplicity and clarity in mind, this project serves as an accessible introduction to Python programming and a practical exercise for those looking to reinforce their skills.

Key features of the ATM interface include:

Clear User Interface: The interface presents users with straightforward options for conducting transactions, ensuring ease of use and minimizing confusion.
Essential Functionality: Users can perform core banking operations, including checking their account balance, withdrawing cash in specified denominations, and depositing funds into their account.
Error Handling: The interface incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage invalid inputs and unexpected scenarios, providing helpful feedback to users.
Modular Code Structure: The codebase is organized into modular components, facilitating code reuse, maintenance, and extensibility.
